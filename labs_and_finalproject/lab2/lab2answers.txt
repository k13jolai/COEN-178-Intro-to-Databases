Part 1)
	a)After trying to insert the value into Schedule, I received an error saying JLAI.DAYCONSTRAINT was violated.
	This is because there is a constraint on day that checks that the entered day is a weekday (m,t,w,r,f). Since the day entered was not 
	on the table, the constraint was not satisfied. 

	b)After trying to enter the second value into the table, I received an error constraint saying that the parent key was not found. I believe that this
	is because the first value dne5 is supposed to be a reference to the table "DeliveryService." Since dne5 is not a valid value in dne5, the constraint
	was not satisfied. 

Part 3)
	b) No, the correct result was not produced
	c) It is a non-correlated subquery 
	d) The reason is because the subquery is always true.
